Prediction of compressive strength of Cement using Feature Engineering, Domain Analysis, Model Selection and Tuning


Exploratory Data Analysis with Univariate and Multivariate analysis, with strategies to address data challenges esp. zero and unknown values, outliers etc.

Domain analysis: Understanding inter-relation of various factors that comtribute to compressive strength of cement 

Feature Engineering: Exploring opportunities to create composite features, drop insignificant features and transformation of some features 

Feature Engineering: Exploring gaussians to understand if data is likely to be a mix of gaussians, exploring individual cluster and independent attributes for their suitability to predict strength

Feature Engineering: Obtaining feature importance for the individual features using multiple methods 

Model Selection and Tuning: Trying with various model complexities - from simple linear mode in terms of parameters or with a quadratic or higher degree 

Model Selection and Tuning: Explore suitable algorithms for the data 

Statistical conclusion for predicting model performance range at 95% confidence level
